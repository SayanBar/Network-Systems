UDP(Use Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless transmission model with a minimum of protocol mechanism.
It has no handshaking dialogues and no mechanism of acknowledgements(ACKs). Therefore, every packet delivered
by using UDP protocol is not guaranteed to be received. Thatâ€™s why UDP is an unreliability protocol.
Due to the simplicity, it avoids unnecessary delay in some specific application such as streaming media.

There are 5 functionalities this application serves:

1.get [file name]
2.put [file name]
3.ls
4.delete [file name]
5.exit

Get- This function is used to receive a file from the other side which could be the server or the client if the other one is requestiong for it.

Put- This function is used to send a file from client to server or server to client

Ls-This function is used to display the list of files on the server's current directory

Delete- This function is used to delete a particular file from the server.

Exit- This function terminates the socket and exits the code both on the client and the server side.


There are two folders and one file in tar.gz file. After extracting, it should show a client folder and a server folder along with the readme file which you are reading right now.

In order to run the code,
-Go to the client folder through the terminal. Compile using make or clean using clean.
-Go to the server folder through another terminal and make or clean.
-Run server code with ./server [port_no]
-Run client code with ./client [ip] [port_no]
-The display looks like this

1.get 
2.put 
3.ls
4.delete
5.exit


Type in any of the numbers before the respective functions as input. For example, to delete type 3 and when prompted for the file name, input the filename to delete it from the server.

For running the code on the local machine,
./client 127.0.0.1 5002
./server 5002

For running the code on the remote machine,
ssh into the remote server using your identikey and password
Type ifconfig to get the ip address of the remote server
./client [ip_address_of_the_remote_server] 5003
./server 5003
